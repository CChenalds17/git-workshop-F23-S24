# T4SG Git Workshop (F23-S24) Activity

This activity consists of a series of small exercises to apply the concepts in the workshop slides in practice. In the activity, you will:
- add, commit, and commit changes to a forked version of the repository 
- create new branches and practice merging, rebasing, and creating pull requests 
- resolve merge conflicts 
- revert and reset commits 

Aside from forking and cloning the repository on to your machine, all the exercises below can be done independently. Feel free skip questions if you're stuck or want to move on!
