1. Before you start building, choose a spot on the beach that is away from the water's edge but still close enough to get wet sand easily. The ideal location should have a mix of wet and dry sand for the best results.

2. Now that you have a solid foundation, it's time to shape your sandcastle. Use your hands to start forming the towers and walls. Be creative and give your sandcastle a unique design.

3. Once you've gathered all your tools, begin by creating a strong foundation for your sandcastle. Pile up a mound of sand and then pack it down firmly to create a stable base.

4. Next, start gathering the necessary tools. You will need a bucket to collect water, shovels to dig and move sand, and some small carving tools or plastic utensils to add details to your sandcastle.
