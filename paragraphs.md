After shaping the main structure, it's time to add the finishing touches. Use shells, sticks, or other beach treasures to decorate your sandcastle and make it stand out.

Building a sandcastle can be a fun and rewarding activity at the beach. Follow these steps to create your masterpiece in the sand and enjoy the process!

Once you have the foundation and rough shape in place, it's time to add water. Fill the bucket with seawater and pour it over the sandcastle. The water will help bind the sand particles together, making it easier to sculpt.

Continue building up your sandcastle by adding more layers of wet sand and shaping them accordingly. Remember to pack each layer firmly to maintain stability.

Finally, step back and admire your creation! Take some photos to capture the memory and enjoy the satisfaction of building a beautiful sandcastle at the beach.
